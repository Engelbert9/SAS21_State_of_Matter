            <p>
             <i>In physics, a state of matter is one of the distinct forms in which matter can exist. Four states of matter are observable in everyday life: <br>solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. Many intermediate states are known to exist, such as liquid crystal, and some states only exist under extreme<br> conditions, such as Bose–Einstein condensates (in extreme cold), neutron-degenerate matter (in extreme density), and quark–gluon plasma (at <br>extremely high energy). For a complete list of all exotic states of matter, see the list of states of matter.<br><br>
             Historically, the distinction is made based on qualitative differences in properties. Matter in the solid state maintains a fixed volume <br>(assuming no change in temperature or air pressure) and shape, with component particles (atoms, molecules or ions) close together and fixed into<br>place. Matter in the liquid state maintains a fixed volume (assuming no change in temperature or air pressure), but has a variable shape that <br>adapts to fit its container. Its particles are still close together but move freely. Matter in the gaseous state has both variable volume and <br>shape, adapting both to fit its container. Its particles are neither close together nor fixed in place. Matter in the plasma state has variable <br>volume and shape, and contains neutral atoms as well as a significant number of ions and electrons, both of which can move around freely.</i>

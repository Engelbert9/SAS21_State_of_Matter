            <h1>What is LIQUID?</h1>
            <p>
            <i>A liquid is a nearly incompressible fluid that conforms to the shape of its container but retains a (nearly) constant volume independent of<br> pressure. As such, it is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being solid, gas, and plasma), and is the only state with a<br> definite volume but no fixed shape. A liquid is made up of tiny vibrating particles of matter, such as atoms, held together by intermolecular <br>bonds. Like a gas, a liquid is able to flow and take the shape of a container. Most liquids resist compression, although others can be cont Unlike<br> a gas, a liquid does not disperse to fill every space of a container, and maintains a fairly constant density. A distinctive property of the <br>liquid state is surface tension, leading to wetting phenomena. Water is by far the most common liquid on Earth.The density of a liquid is<br>usually close to that of a solid, and much higher than that of a gas. Therefore, liquid and solid are both termed condensed matter. On the other<br> hand, as liquids and gases share the ability to flow, they are both called fluids. Although liquid water is abundant on Earth, this state of<br> matter is actually the least common in the known universe, because liquids require a relatively narrow temperature/pressure range to exist. Most <br>known matter in the universe is in gaseous form (with traces of detectable solid matter) as interstellar clouds or plasma from within stars.</i>
